  "ai_description": "Enchanted Fang Caps of the Expectorating Tizheruk is a Fleeting Item. Fun Fact. There is not a single dentist from your world left in the dungeon. A few made it to the first floor, but every single one of those fuckers is now tits up. There's a few hygienists left, but I wouldn't want to rely on those chuckleheads. So what I'm getting at is that you need to install these yourself. Make sure they're facing the right direction. You can always take them off but this is a fleeting Item. That means they disappear once they're off. So don't fuck it up. Turns two of your incisors into ripping, tearing, deadly choppers that would impress even the most self-hating goth.",
