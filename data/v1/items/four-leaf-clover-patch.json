This upgrade patch depicts a perfectly-perfect, mouthwatering human foot treading upon a patch of four-leaf clovers, creasing them as it presses down with gentle but oh-so-firm force. Despite their non-sentient nature, the clovers have a brief moment of awareness as they suffer, and it is fucking delicious. Affixing this patch to an eligible garment will imbue the following benefits: Lucky Shot. A fatal blow will be deflected into the body of a party member instead. This benefit may only be used once per floor.",
