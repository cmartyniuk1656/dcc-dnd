  "ai_description": "Enchanted Tiara of the Inebriated Dragonfly. There's a children's story out there about a dragonfly who gets so drunk that his wife won't let him come home, so he hovers in the air above their nest, waiting for her to go to sleep, so he can get to bed. The thing is, the wife knows he's out there, and she ain't moving. So the dragonfly either hovers all night or moves to the highest point, sitting on a leaf, overlooking his home, waiting for his wife to turn the light back on to signify he's out of the doghouse. This tiara has been made to honor that poor Dragonfly with the angry wife. This citrine-encrusted tiara, when equipped, imbues the following effects: * 50% reduction to potion cooldown * +10 int * Protection from poison * Negates the dexterity debuff when inebriated * Level 10 hover skill (5 uses a day)",
