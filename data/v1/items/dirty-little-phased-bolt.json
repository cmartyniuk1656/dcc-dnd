It will hide its entry point and will only be discovered if it is physically touched. The perfect ammunition for the discerning crossbow assassin. This item will cast both Temporary Amnesia and Suffering Bleed onto its victim, draining them of health until they are at 10%. A second bolt will lower the victimâ€™s health to 1%. Victims who subsequently perish will be listed as dying from an alternate source. You will not get credit or experience for the kill. Nor will you get one of those nasty skulls by your name if you happen to kill a fellow Crawler. Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.",

  "description": "Dirty Little Phased Bolts are magical crossbow bolts that reduce the target's health to just shy of 0%, as well induce amnesia and health-sapping Bleed effects. The debuffs do not show over the target's head and cannot be seen in the Party Menu. The crawler who fired the bolts will not receive experience if the target dies, but will not receive a Player Killer Skull if the target was another crawler.",
