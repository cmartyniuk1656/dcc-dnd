  "ai_description": "Surefire adds the “Guided” status to any projectile, powered or not. It may be utilized on a vast array of crafting tables. If added to an arrow or bolt, you must choose a target prior to unleashing the weapon, and the projectile will seek that target. If added to a trap, additional options become available. Such as “Target any healers within range” or “Target anyone who thinks it’s okay to put mayonnaise on hotdogs.” If added to a powered weapon, such as an explosive-based rocket, targets may be assigned during the crafting process or upon firing, but not both. Note: this upgrade alone does not add range to the projectile.",
