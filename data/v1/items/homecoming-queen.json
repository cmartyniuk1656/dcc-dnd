  "description": "Originally a biological waste freighter, the spaceship is approximately twice as large as a Valtay warship and easily the largest of the crafts trapped in Earth's solar system. Recently renamed and converted to transport live creatures, she has built-in scramblers to prevent security sweepers from detecting the extra life on board, specifically the 50,000 former crawlers hidden in her hull preparing to join the Princess Posse in the Ninth Floor Faction Wars.",
