If this upgrade patch is affixed to an eligible garment, it will imbue the following upgrades: * Neutral mobs are less likely to fall into aggro. * +10% to Dexterity. * +10% skill in playing the bongos. Warning: Upgrade patches are fleeting items. You may remove them, but they will be destroyed in the process.",
