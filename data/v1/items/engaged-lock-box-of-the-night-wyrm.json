  "description": "The Engaged Lock Box of the Night Wyrm is a small box made of dark wood and engraved with spiderweb patterns; through its slats, a pink orchid is visible. The box crackles with dark energy. Three metallic claws rise out of the wood, each holding a marble-sized purple jewel representing a magical seal. The active seals glow; broken seals look 'cracked and burned-out, like spent flashbulbs.'",
