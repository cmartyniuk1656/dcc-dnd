It’s appropriate you have a patch depicting it. This patch is finely made, which means all below upgrades are enhanced. If this upgrade patch is affixed to an eligible garment, it will imbue the following upgrades: +11% to Constitution. +6% damage to all explosives. +2 to the Dangerous Explosives Handling Skill. +15% Discount from traveling Spider Reaper Minion merchants. Warning: Upgrade patches are fleeting items. You may remove them, but they will be destroyed in the process.",
