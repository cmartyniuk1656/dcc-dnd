That whole saying, the pen is mightier than the sword, is one of the few human world metaphors that I believe to be universally true, especially since swords are terrible, barbaric weapons. This is the most versatile item anyone can own. What will you do with it? Write a book that changes everything? Come up with a new, titillating take on hucow fiction? (Don’t look that up.) Or will you literally stab someone in the neck with it again? It’s really up to you.",
