  "description": "The tractor-sized Murder Dozer is haphazardly constructed of rusting hunks of metal, runs on tank-like treads, and has several pipes billowing out black smoke. A spinning wheel covered in spikes whirrs on the front of the machine, and there's a small ladder on the back. It sounds like a steam engine and has a wide turn radius. The top of the machine is a fur-lined recessed hole with benches enough to seat fifteen goblins.",
