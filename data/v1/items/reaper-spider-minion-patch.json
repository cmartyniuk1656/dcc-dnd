These guys are known for their sense of humor, and I highly recommend the first thing you do the next time you meet one is to insult them. Theyâ€™ll love it. Affixing this patch to an eligible garment will imbue the following benefits: * Access to the [[Midnight Market]]. Safety or Sanity not guaranteed. * You will receive a notification if any traveling merchants are nearby. * Plus 5% to [[Dexterity]]. Warning: Upgrade patches are fleeting items. You may remove them, but they will be destroyed in the process.",
